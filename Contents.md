**Where can I ask questions?**
First make sure to read #rules and #read-before-posting (optionally also #get-a-role)
For common Unity questions go to #unity-dev

**How do I install Unity?**
You need to first download Unity Hub which is used for managing different Unity versions.
You can download Unity Hub here: <https://unity.com/download>
Once you have Unity Hub installed, run it and follow the instructions.

**Where do I start learning Unity?**
There are many quality tutorials on Unity to be found around the web, but a good starting place is the official Unity learning portal <https://learn.unity.com/>
If you get stuck, you can always ask for help in #unity-dev as well :)
